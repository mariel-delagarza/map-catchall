# What is this

10/12/2023: A collection of repositories related to maps that cover ~May 2022 through ~March 2023. I was exploring different options for a CSIS project and testing work for the [CSIS Ukraine War Map](https://features.csis.org/ukraine-war-map/). Since this work is tangentially related in practice and in how I think about it, I've grouped all of these folders in one spot so I know where to look for things.

- `countries-edited` and `geojson-countries` are a collection of geojson files. I think "countries-edited" was processing them to work with a specific set of data from a CSIS program's excel spreadsheet, and that project was ultimately abandoned. I remember working through `geojson-countries` and editing those files to make them cleaner and more useful long term. The goal was that it serve as a repository for files the next time I need them.
- `global-population` was part of an experiment to see if making a certain kind of map was possible with the given global population data. It and `process-excel-and-json` ended up being references for how to process excel spreadsheets along with geojson data and combine the two.
- `folium-map` is just a test of using Python's Folium 
- `mapbox-over-time` experiment started as me messing with [this Mapbox tutorial](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/show-changes-over-time/) for the Ukraine map.
- `test-map` is a test of the Ukraine map and `final-map` I *think* was the final work before I transfered it to the official repo. 
- `us-canada-geojson` should be a geojson file of just the US and Canada
- `simple-map-d3` is forked from [this repo](https://github.com/MinnPost/simple-map-d3).
